    "title": "False Negative on Conventional PR?",
    "problem": "Overview\n\nI'm using Conventional PR to prevent commits with bad messages to be merged to the main branch. I'm using the default conventional commit pattern\n\n^(build|chore|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|revert|style|test){1}(\\\\(\\[\\w\\\\-\\\\.]+\\\\))?(!)?: (\\[\\w ])+(\\[\\s\\S]\\*)\n\nHowever, it seems commit messages like test commit is still considered to be valid. It seems like the conventional PR doesn't filter commit messages correctly.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe pull request should be considered as invalid, since test commit does not conform the regex.\n\nActual Behavior\n\nThe pull request is considered as valid.",
    "solution": "Update the regular expression pattern to correctly filter out commit messages that do not conform to the desired format."
